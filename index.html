                    of focus are in Web and Mobile Apps, with a specific focus in React and
                    Android. Speed and efficiency are what I focus on when creating a project. It
                    needs to be simple, work properly, and get done in timely manor that doesn't
                    break the bank. I have experience with other frameworks as well including
                    Vue, PHP and Flutter (experimental Android / iOS language). Most of my
                    previous projects have used Amazon Web Services, Firebase or MongoDB. I
                    have a special interest in creating databases and REST api's in either MySQL
                    or NoSQL. Feel free to contact with any questions to.</td>
